* Medard

This is really just a practice project

** Development

1. Start a shell with =nix develop=
2. Try calling =setup= if you don't have quicklisp installed, it will install it. If you do, make sure that it starts by default in sbcl
3. call run - that'll start a swank server you can connect to with slime
